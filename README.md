## Hi there, i'm Natalia ðŸ‘‹ 
My skills include manual testing (Git, DevTools, SQL, basic HTML/CSS), test analysis, documentation, mobile and web testing, defect tracking, and bug reporting.

I am a highly efficient and detail-oriented individual, adaptable to new environments, and capable of finding creative solutions to complex problems.
